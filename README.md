### Original Paper

[NeurIPs 2022: Gradient Descent: The Ultimate Optimizer](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2022/hash/36ce475705c1dc6c50a5956cedff3d01-Abstract-Conference.html)  

Authors: Kartik Chandra, Audrey Xie, Jonathan Ragan-Kelley, ERIK MEIJER

### Original Code: 

(Github Link)[https://github.com/kach/gradient-descent-the-ultimate-optimizer]

### How to run our code:

1. Download ipynb files - (sgd_on_streiods.ipynb to run our custom SGD, extending_datasets.ipynb to view results of original gdtuo against the CIFAR-100 and Iris datatsets)
2. Run it on Colab or local environment in VS Code
   
### Optimized Optimizer: Unveiling the Power of Gradient Descent 

This research extends gradient descent optimization by recursively stacking hyperparameters, inspired by Chandra et al. (2022). Our approach, implemented in PyTorch, demonstrates enhanced convergence, generalization, and adaptability across diverse datasets. Find the code at [GitHub](https://github.com/dghosh2/gdtuo-extension).

We have also extended the testing domain by testing against CIFAR-100 and Iris Datasets and reported our findings in our paper. 

Further, we have introduced new hyperparamaters in the original GDTUO's Ultimate_SGD's code:
- Dampening: This factor makes the optimization process smoother. It reduces the intensity of the updates made to the model’s parameters, providing stability and preventing drastic changes that might hinder convergence.

- Weight Decay: Weight decay (wd) helps control the size of the model’s parameters during the training process, preventing them from becoming too large, which can lead to overfitting. Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data
